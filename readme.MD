-silicone hose 3 meter 10mm ID, 12mm OD

-2x MG 996R servos (any reasonably strong servo will suffice) 
-ELP 5-50mm  (any camera will be OK, some tele is helpful)

3D printing files are for a simple gimbal to hold the nozzle of the water gun. If a another gimbal is already available they are unnecessary.
